# monkey-breed-classification

## problem statement : I have to build a web application that can easily classify the monkeys breeds when user input the monkey images

There are about 200 breeds, or types, of monkey are there. Scientists divide them into two groups, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. In this project I collected the images of 10 different types of breeds of monkeys.

I divided the images of monkeys into training set and validation set. training data contains images of 10 different breeds of monkey for training purpose. 
and validation set also contains the images of 10 different breeds of monkeys for testing purpose.
I have one txt file that contains the labels, names and count of training and validation data of 10 different breeds.
