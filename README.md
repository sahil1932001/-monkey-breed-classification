# monkey-breed-classification

## problem statement : I have to build a web application that can easily classify the monkeys breeds when user input the monkey images

There are about 200 breeds, or types, of monkey are there. Scientists divide them into two groups, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. In this project I collected the images of 10 different types of breeds of monkeys.
